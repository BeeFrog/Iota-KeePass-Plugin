# Iota-KeePass-Plugin

A basic KeePass plugin for creating an Iota Seed with a number of address for offline use.

# To Install
Build solution then copy IOTAAddressCreation.dll and BeeFrog.Iota.Api.dll to your KeePass plugin folder. 

Start KeePass. 

You will not have an extra item in the tools menu to create addresses.

If you trust me (and you shouldn't) then you can copy the files from the release folder.
